## Quasar CLI Installation

How to install the Quasar CLI on your development machine.


Make sure you have Node >=8 and NPM >=5 installed on your machine.

```bash
# Uninstall quasar-cli if you have it from <1.0 versions
$ npm uninstall -g quasar-cli

# Node.js >= 8.9.0 is required.
$ npm install -g @quasar/cli
```

Then we start the development server with Quasar CLI:

```bash
$ quasar dev
```
